# Enuo - 2D RPG Adventure

Hey there, fellow adventurers! Welcome to the mystical world of **Enuo**

## What's Enuo All About?

Enuo is a passion project I've been dreaming about for a while. It's a 2D role-playing game where you'll explore dungeons, battle monsters, find treasures, and uncover the secrets of a fantasy world filled with both wonder and danger.

## The Tech Behind the Magic

I'm building this adventure using:
- **C++** as the main programming language
- **raylib** as the game engine
- **Tiled** for creating and designing game maps (using .tmx files)
- **LUA scripting** for UI elements and game logic customization

## Current Development Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress!** ðŸš§

The project is in active development, and I'll be updating this repository as I make progress. Feel free to star and watch if you're interested in following along!

## Planned Features

- Immersive 2D dungeon system
- Character progression system
- Interactive NPCs and dialogue system
- Inventory and equipment management
- Quest system
- Custom UI powered by LUA
